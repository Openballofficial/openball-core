OpenBall Membership (OBM) – Whitepaper v1.0
1. Executive Summary

OpenBall is an advanced Web3 ecosystem combining dual-token economics, NFT mechanics, and PvP gaming. The project leverages blockchain technology to offer players an immersive, community-driven experience. Through OBM (OpenBall Membership) and OBT (OpenBall Token), OpenBall will provide staking, NFTs, and a fully integrated play-to-earn game. This whitepaper outlines our ecosystem, tokenomics, staking mechanics, and the long-term roadmap that will establish OpenBall as a leader in Web3 gaming.
2. Introduction

OpenBall introduces a new dimension to blockchain-based gaming with a dual-token system designed to incentivize participation, governance, and growth. The OBM token serves as a membership utility token granting access to staking rewards, whitelist tiers, and exclusive NFT drops. Meanwhile, OBT serves as the in-game currency, driving the economic backbone of OpenBall's PvP/PvE game system.

OpenBall is built on WorldChain, a scalable blockchain platform that ensures fast transactions and seamless integration with external ecosystems. The game’s core focus is on creating a sustainable, enjoyable economy for both players and investors, utilizing NFT creatures, PvP battles, staking mechanics, and a play-to-earn ecosystem.
3. OBM Token Overview

    Name: OpenBall Membership (OBM)

    Ticker: OBM

    Blockchain: WorldChain

    Contract Address: 0x86e81db6cd2FA43c9a280c374368C7Be1e6f1141

    Total Supply: 100,000,000 OBM

    Decimals: 18

    Utility: OBM serves as a community utility token used for staking, governance, event participation, and NFT evolution.

OBM Key Features:

    Staking: OBM will be used in staking pools to earn rewards in the form of OBT and exclusive NFTs.

    Whitelist Tiers: Holders of OBM can gain access to early staking rewards, token swaps, and special events.

    Governance: OBM holders will have voting power in the development and expansion of the OpenBall ecosystem.

    NFT Integration: OBM plays a role in unlocking exclusive NFTs and higher-tier creatures in the OpenBall game.

4. OBM Tokenomics
Total Supply: 100,000,000 OBM

    Team Allocation: 10% (locked for 1 year)

    Ecosystem Fund: 20% (vesting model over 2 years)

    Creator Holding: 26% (allocated through PUF Launch and held for buybacks)

    Community + DEX Supply: 44% (circulating OBM and liquidity pools)

    Buyback Reserve: 250,000 OBM (used for liquidity support and price stabilization)

Burn Mechanism:

A portion of OBM tokens will be burned after transactions to decrease supply and increase token value. The system will feature dynamic burn events based on game activity and platform interactions.
5. OBT Token Overview

    Token Name: OpenBall Token (OBT)

    Ticker: OBT

    Blockchain: WorldChain (Future cross-chain integrations)

    Total Supply: Variable (to be determined based on in-game demand)

    Utility: OBT is the in-game currency used for battle staking, purchases, lootboxes, and rewards.

6. Staking Mechanics

Dynamic APY and Whitelist Boosts: OpenBall introduces a dynamic APY system that adjusts based on the amount of OBM staked and the length of the staking period. Additionally, we offer whitelist boosts for OBM holders. The longer you stake and the higher your whitelist level, the better the rewards.

Liquidity Pools:
We will introduce LP farming mechanisms where players provide liquidity to DEX pools in exchange for staking rewards in OBT.
7. Gameplay and Game Mechanics

Game Overview:
OpenBall offers a PvP and PvE gaming experience. Players battle using their NFT creatures in arenas, with varying difficulty levels, and gain rewards such as OBT, exclusive NFTs, and rare items.

NFT Evolution: Creatures in OpenBall undergo an evolutionary process with three stages: Organic → BioMech → Mecha-Core. Players can enhance their creatures by evolving them, giving them better stats and special abilities.

Battle System:

    PvP: Players battle each other in 1v1 or 3v3 formats, gaining rankings, rewards, and loot.

    PvE: Players face AI-controlled bosses to gain unique rewards and NFT drops.
